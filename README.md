# Assignment 14: Use a CSS and JavaScript Framework to Add Interactivity to a Website


## Added Bootstrap Component Documentation
I enjoyed browsing through the Bootstrap components to add to my page.
1.  I added a Hero banner that fits well underneath the nav bar at the top of my page.
    I removed a button that wasn't needed for my page, and added a background image.
    I also changed the color of the text to white.
2.  I added a footer component that looked nice for my page.  I gave it the same light
    background color as my navbar so it would be a consistent theme.  I also changed    
    the link text to match my updated link text of my nav bar.
3.  I used cards in my grid columns and rows to include an image with information
    about myself.  The cards then move with the responsive grid system from 2 rows
    to a single row for small devices.
